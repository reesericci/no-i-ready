# *We won.*

After a year of campaigning against the use of the i-Ready software in the Austin Independent School District, it is no longer in use as of the 2021-22 school year. 

Thank you to all the people that signed the petition, and especially the teachers that brought this to the concern of the Austin Independent School District. You made this happen.

Thank You,
